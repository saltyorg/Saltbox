        #   -p                    parseable output in the format of pep8
        #   --parseable-severity  parseable output including severity of rule
        #   -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
        #                         more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
        #                         rules in ansiblelint/rules, unless -R is also used.
        #   -R                    Use default rules in ansiblelint/rules in addition to
        #                         any extra
        #                         rules directories specified with -r. There is no need
        #                         to specify this if no -r flags are used
        #   -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
        #   -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
        #                         values
        #   --nocolor             disable colored output

        #   -c C                  Specify configuration file to use. Defaults to ".ansible-lint"

        # [305] Use shell only when shell functionality is required
        # [306] Shells that use pipes should set the pipefail option

        # [403] Package installs should not use latest
        # [503] Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
